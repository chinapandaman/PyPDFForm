"""
This module defines the `ImageField` and `ImageWidget` classes, which are used
to represent and manipulate image form fields within PDF documents.

The `ImageField` class is a dataclass that encapsulates the properties of an
image field, inheriting from `SignatureField` for its dimensional attributes.

The `ImageWidget` class extends the base `SignatureWidget` class to provide
specific functionality for interacting with image form fields in PDFs,
leveraging the existing infrastructure for positioning and rendering.

    This class inherits from the SignatureWidget and is specifically designed

    infrastructure for positioning and rendering, but instead of capturing
    a signature, it inserts a provided image.
