"""
This module defines the `RadioGroup` and `RadioWidget` classes, which are used
to represent and manipulate radio button groups within PDF documents.

The `RadioGroup` class is a dataclass that encapsulates the properties of a
radio button group, such as its coordinates and shape.

The `RadioWidget` class extends the base `CheckBoxWidget` class to provide
specific functionality for interacting with radio button form fields in PDFs.

    Represents a group of radio buttons in a PDF document.

    This dataclass extends the `CheckBoxField` base class and defines the specific
    attributes that can be configured for a radio button group. Unlike a single
    checkbox, a radio group allows for multiple positions (x, y coordinates)
    where individual radio buttons can be placed, but only one can be selected.

    Attributes:
        _field_type (str): The type of the field, fixed as "radio".
        x (List[float]): A list of x-coordinates for each radio button in the group.
        y (List[float]): A list of y-coordinates for each radio button in the group.
        shape (Optional[str]): The shape of the radio button. Valid values are
            "circle" or "square". Defaults to None, which typically means a default circle shape.
