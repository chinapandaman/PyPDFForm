# 2025-11-22: V4 Announcements

Hello PyPDFForm community! A major release, v4.0.0, is planned for New Year's Day 2026. This release will officially remove APIs currently marked as deprecated and emitting warnings.

Below is a list of these APIs and their alternatives:

* `PdfWrapper.adobe_mode` will be removed; use `PdfWrapper.need_appearances`.
* `PdfWrapper.create_widget()` will be removed; use `PdfWrapper.create_field()`.
* The new `PdfWrapper.draw()` API replaces older drawing APIs:
    * `PdfWrapper.draw_text()` will be removed; use `PdfWrapper.draw()` with `PyPDFForm.RawElements.RawText`.
    * `PdfWrapper.draw_image()` will be removed; use `PdfWrapper.draw()` with `PyPDFForm.RawElements.RawImage`.
* `PyPDFForm.Text` will be removed; use `PyPDFForm.Widgets.Text`.

Please go through this list and consider migrating to the new APIs, or pin your version if you wish to use the old APIs.

Happy hacking!
